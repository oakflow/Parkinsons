# Parkinson’s Screening Prototype

This project is a **prototype Parkinson’s screening application** built as part of a first-year university course and developed collaboratively in a small group using **Elm**.

The goal of this app was to explore how **interactive drawing tasks** ✏️ could potentially be used to assess motor control, accuracy, and memory, inspired by real clinical screening techniques.

> ⚠️ **Important**: This is **not a medical tool**.
> It is strictly a **proof-of-concept / demo** and should not be used for diagnosis.

## 📋 Overview

The app walks users through a set of **drawing challenges** 🎨 where they attempt to trace predefined shapes.

### Current features

- Start screen & navigation
- Level selection system
- Drawing canvas with tools
- Timer system
- Tracing algorithm
- Accuracy feedback screen
- Simplified UX/UI

## ⚠️ Prototype Limitations

Since this was an early-stage academic project, several planned features were **not fully implemented**:

- Star ratings are **not actually computed** from accuracy
- No memory testing (e.g., recalling shapes after final level)
- No level history
- Accuracy scoring is **rough & experimental**
- No backend or data storage

The app should be viewed as:

> **An interactive demo + concept exploration**, not a finished product.
